                    In a war-torn world, with the Wild Hunt on your back, you'll take on your most important contract -- to track down the child of prophecy, a key and a weapon which can save or destroy all.
                </p>
                <ul>

                        <b>
                            Child of Prophecy

                        <p>
                            In Wild Hunt, you as Geralt embark on your most epic and dangerous journey yet. Your mission -- to find the child of prophecy, an ashen-haired girl, a living and highly volatile weapon everyone wants to control. The stakes have never been higher: the Elder Blood flowing in the child's veins can bring about a final end. The fate of worlds lies with you.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            The Wild Hunt - for ages the appearance of this cavalcade of ghostly riders in the night sky has presaged war, plague and death. Few know the riders' true nature or origin, yet fear grips all at their passing. It is believed they steal souls to add to their ghastly retinue. They come at night, in the cold of winter, and the Aurora Borealis always preceded their appearance.
                            Romance
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            The world of The Witcher boasts pleasures aplenty. Enjoy yourself in taverns and cabarets, play cards, drink with friends and romance ladies... or stay faithful to the love of your life -- the powerful sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg.
                            Choice and Consequence
                        </p>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Geralt's mission will require him to make hard choices. Witchers strive to remain neutral, but often find themselves deciding the fate of others. And rarely are these simple choices between good and evil. In this morally gray world, the choices they make can tip the scales of life and death. Wild Hunt features multiple endings that result from choices you make throughout the game. With three extensive epilogues and multiple world end-states in each, the game delivers unmatched replayability.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The enemy of your enemy is your friend - you can't afford to care if they're virtuous to the core, or ruthless or otherwise vile. Geralt is a professional, and if it helps get the job done, he'll accept the aid of scoundrels and brutes, as well as sorceresses and jolly dwarves. In his line of work, he can also become a target.</p>
