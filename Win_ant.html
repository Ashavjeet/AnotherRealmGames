                    <b>In the beginning, the Gods harnessed the Anthem</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Anthem is a source of pure creation. Wonderous lands erupted into existence. Colossal beasts, creatures, and monster emerged. But before their work was complete, the Gods vanished, leaving an unfinished world strewn with the instruments of their creation. The power of the Anthem would not be contained, unleashing world-altering cataclysms, transforming and corrupting those that tried to wield its power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humanity sought a way to survive, so our ancestors created The Javelin Exosuits, handcrafted armour that gave us superhuman abilities. Our world remains in an eternal struggle between the power of the Anthem and the instruments of the Gods who formed it. Today, the fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small band of Javelin Pilots know as The Freelancers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adventure together, triumph as one
                </p>
                <p>
                    Team with up to three other players in cooperative adventures that reward both combined effort and individual skill. Each player’s choice of Javelin exosuit will shape their contribution and strategic role. As you explore, you will discover a gripping story filled with unique and memorable characters. Seamless and intelligent matchmaking will ensure you can quickly and easily find other players to adventure alongside.

                    The ultimate armour, suit up with Javelins
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every time you enter the world as a Freelancer, you’ll select a powerful Javelin exosuit – armor designed to provide its pilot with incredible offensive and defensive capabilities. Move at incredible speed, rocket across the skies, or safely roam watery depths. As you play, you will constantly progress both your own abilities as a Javelin pilot and the combat and traversal capabilities of your growing collection of exosuits.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ranger - this is basically the default suit. A good all rounder for combat, armour and mobility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Colossus - the tank option, with high armour and a focus on area of effect attacks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Storm - The Storm suit is effectively the magic user, potentially with a support use. Concept art for the design has shown it with a range of elemental looking abilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interceptor -  the hot rod of the gang. The fastest and lightest of the options here.
                    </li>
